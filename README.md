* `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)
* `rating` (Integer 1–5)
* `comment` (Text)

**Description**:
Reviews are written by guests after completing a booking. A guest can write one review per property per booking.

---

### Entity Relationships Summary

* A **User** (host) can have **many Properties**.
* A **User** (guest) can make **many Bookings**.
* A **Property** can receive **many Bookings** and **many Reviews**.
* A **Booking** has **one Payment**.
* A **Review** links a **guest** to a **property** with feedback and rating.

## Feature Breakdown

This section outlines the core features of the Airbnb Clone backend, each designed to mirror real-world Airbnb functionality and provide a seamless user experience.

### User Management

Handles user registration, login, authentication, and profile updates. It ensures secure access and assigns roles (guest, host, or admin) that define the user’s capabilities within the platform.

### Property Management

Allows hosts to create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. This feature supports key listing details such as price, availability, and location, enabling hosts to showcase their accommodations to potential guests.

### Booking System

Enables guests to reserve properties for specific dates, with validation to prevent double bookings. It manages the full lifecycle of a booking, including check-in and check-out tracking.

### Payment Processing

Handles secure transactions for confirmed bookings. It records payment status, amount, and method, ensuring traceability and integration with future features like refunds or payouts.

### Review System

Allows guests to leave feedback and ratings after their stay. Reviews help maintain quality standards and build trust between users, influencing booking decisions.

### API Access (REST & GraphQL)

Provides structured, programmatic access to all core resources via RESTful endpoints and flexible GraphQL queries. This dual interface supports both mobile and web client integration.

### Performance Optimization

Implements caching and database indexing to enhance speed and efficiency. These optimizations are crucial for handling high-traffic scenarios and ensuring a smooth user experience.


## API Security

Ensuring the security of the Airbnb Clone backend is essential to protect user data, financial transactions, and platform integrity. The system will implement several key security measures to safeguard all operations.

### Authentication

Users must authenticate via secure methods such as token-based authentication (e.g., JWT). This ensures that only verified users can access protected endpoints, preventing unauthorized access.

**Why it's important**: Authentication protects personal data and user accounts, ensuring that actions like booking or listing properties are performed by legitimate users.



### Authorization

Role-based access control (RBAC) will restrict actions based on user roles (e.g., guest, host, admin). Each endpoint will check permissions before allowing access to sensitive operations.

**Why it's important**: Authorization ensures that users can only perform actions relevant to their role, such as preventing guests from modifying properties or accessing admin features.



### Rate Limiting

APIs will enforce rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. This includes setting thresholds for login attempts, data requests, and booking submissions.

**Why it's important**: Rate limiting protects the system from being overwhelmed by malicious traffic and helps maintain performance for all users.



### Input Validation & Sanitization

All input data will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

**Why it's important**: Validating inputs protects against common attack vectors that can compromise data integrity and platform stability.



### Secure Payment Handling

Payment endpoints will be protected with HTTPS, tokenized transactions, and integration with secure third-party payment processors.

**Why it's important**: Securing payment flows is critical to prevent fraud, protect financial data, and maintain user trust.


### HTTPS & Data Encryption

All API traffic will be encrypted using HTTPS, and sensitive data (e.g., passwords) will be hashed and stored securely.

**Why it's important**: Encryption ensures that data transmitted between clients and servers cannot be intercepted or altered by third parties.


## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD is a development practice that automates the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying updates to production environments. CI/CD pipelines help ensure that every code change is verified and safely delivered with minimal manual intervention.

### Why It’s Important

CI/CD pipelines help maintain code quality, reduce deployment risks, and accelerate development cycles. For the Airbnb Clone project, CI/CD enables rapid updates, early bug detection, and consistent deployment processes—ensuring the backend remains stable and reliable as new features are added.

### Recommended Tools

* **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing, building, and deployment workflows directly within GitHub.
* **Docker**: Provides consistent, containerized environments across development, testing, and production stages.
* **pytest/Django test suite**: Runs automated tests for code validation.
* **DigitalOcean**: For deploying and hosting the application.
