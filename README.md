## Summary of Overview and Tech Stack

### Overview

The Airbnb Clone backend replicates key features of the Airbnb platform, focusing on user management, property listings, booking flows, payment processing, and reviews. It aims to provide a secure, scalable, and well-documented API using REST and GraphQL, with performance enhancements such as caching and indexing. The system supports both hosts and guests, ensuring smooth interactions and efficient data handling.

### Technology Stack

* **Django** – Core web framework for backend development.
* **Django REST Framework** – For building RESTful APIs.
* **GraphQL** – Enables flexible and precise data queries.
* **PostgreSQL** – Reliable relational database system.
* **Celery** – Handles background tasks asynchronously.
* **Redis** – Used for caching and task queue management.
* **Docker** – Ensures consistent development and deployment.
* **CI/CD Pipelines** – Automates testing and deployment workflows.


## Team Roles

A well-structured development team is essential for delivering a scalable and maintainable Airbnb Clone backend. Below are the key roles, drawn from both the project overview and industry standards like those outlined by ITRexGroup:

### Backend Developer

Responsible for implementing the core logic of the application, including building API endpoints, managing business rules, and integrating third-party services. They also handle authentication, data validation, and performance tuning.

### Database Administrator (DBA)

Designs, implements, and maintains the database architecture. Their tasks include schema creation, indexing strategies, data integrity enforcement, backup planning, and performance optimization to ensure high availability and data security.

### DevOps Engineer

Oversees infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and system monitoring. They automate testing and deployment (CI/CD), manage Docker environments, and ensure the system runs reliably at scale with tools like Kubernetes, logging, and monitoring services.

### QA Engineer

Ensures the application meets functional and non-functional requirements through systematic testing. They write and execute test cases, manage automated testing suites, and verify that APIs, database logic, and integrations behave as expected.
