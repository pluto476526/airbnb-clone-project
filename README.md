## Team Roles

A well-structured development team is essential for delivering a scalable and maintainable Airbnb Clone backend. Below are the key roles, drawn from both the project overview and industry standards like those outlined by ITRexGroup:

### Backend Developer

Responsible for implementing the core logic of the application, including building API endpoints, managing business rules, and integrating third-party services. They also handle authentication, data validation, and performance tuning.

### Database Administrator (DBA)

Designs, implements, and maintains the database architecture. Their tasks include schema creation, indexing strategies, data integrity enforcement, backup planning, and performance optimization to ensure high availability and data security.

### DevOps Engineer

Oversees infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and system monitoring. They automate testing and deployment (CI/CD), manage Docker environments, and ensure the system runs reliably at scale with tools like Kubernetes, logging, and monitoring services.

### QA Engineer

Ensures the application meets functional and non-functional requirements through systematic testing. They write and execute test cases, manage automated testing suites, and verify that APIs, database logic, and integrations behave as expected.

* `title` (String)
* `location` (String)
* `price_per_night` (Decimal)

**Description**:
Each property is owned by a host (user) and can be booked by multiple guests. Properties can also receive multiple reviews.

---

### Bookings

**Key Fields**:

* `booking_id` (Primary Key, UUID)
* `guest_id` (Foreign Key → Users)
* `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)
* `check_in` (Date)
* `check_out` (Date)

**Description**:
Each booking is made by a guest for a specific property. One property can have many bookings over time.

---

### Payments

**Key Fields**:

* `payment_id` (Primary Key, UUID)
* `booking_id` (Foreign Key → Bookings)
* `amount` (Decimal)
* `status` (Enum: pending, completed, failed)
* `payment_date` (DateTime)

**Description**:
Each payment is linked to a specific booking and captures the transaction details for that booking.

---

### Reviews

**Key Fields**:

* `review_id` (Primary Key, UUID)
* `guest_id` (Foreign Key → Users)
* `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)
* `rating` (Integer 1–5)
* `comment` (Text)

**Description**:
Reviews are written by guests after completing a booking. A guest can write one review per property per booking.

---

### Entity Relationships Summary

* A **User** (host) can have **many Properties**.
* A **User** (guest) can make **many Bookings**.
* A **Property** can receive **many Bookings** and **many Reviews**.
* A **Booking** has **one Payment**.
* A **Review** links a **guest** to a **property** with feedback and rating.

## Feature Breakdown

This section outlines the core features of the Airbnb Clone backend, each designed to mirror real-world Airbnb functionality and provide a seamless user experience.

### User Management

Handles user registration, login, authentication, and profile updates. It ensures secure access and assigns roles (guest, host, or admin) that define the user’s capabilities within the platform.

### Property Management

Allows hosts to create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. This feature supports key listing details such as price, availability, and location, enabling hosts to showcase their accommodations to potential guests.

### Booking System

Enables guests to reserve properties for specific dates, with validation to prevent double bookings. It manages the full lifecycle of a booking, including check-in and check-out tracking.

### Payment Processing

Handles secure transactions for confirmed bookings. It records payment status, amount, and method, ensuring traceability and integration with future features like refunds or payouts.

### Review System

Allows guests to leave feedback and ratings after their stay. Reviews help maintain quality standards and build trust between users, influencing booking decisions.

### API Access (REST & GraphQL)

Provides structured, programmatic access to all core resources via RESTful endpoints and flexible GraphQL queries. This dual interface supports both mobile and web client integration.

### Performance Optimization

Implements caching and database indexing to enhance speed and efficiency. These optimizations are crucial for handling high-traffic scenarios and ensuring a smooth user experience.
